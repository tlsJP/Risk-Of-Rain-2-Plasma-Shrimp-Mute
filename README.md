# Risk-Of-Rain-2-Plasma-Shrimp-Mute

Completely removes all sound effects of the Plasma Shrimp. Please read all disclosures!


# Disclosures

1. **Never download RANDOM files from RANDOM people on the internet!!** (yes that includes me)
2. This has been tested without any mods on version **1.2.4.1**
3. Using the steam function to verify game file integrity will likely override this fix (I've not tested this)
4. Any future game patches may also override this fix (obviously not tested)


# Instructions

1. Go to `[steam_games_folder]\Risk of Rain 2\Risk of Rain 2_Data\StreamingAssets\Audio\GeneratedSoundBanks\Windows`
2. Rename `void_critGlasses.bnk` to `void_critGlasses.bnk.orig`
3. From this project, save `void_critGlasses.bnk.mut` to the above folder
4. Rename `void_critGlasses.bnk.mut` to `void_critGlasses.bnk`
5. Enjoy I guess? I personally like the sound...


# Attenuated

If you'd rather the sound effects were attenuated, use the file `void_crit_glasses.bnk.att` instead

# I changed my mind!

 Assuming you followed the instructions properly, just reverse what you've done and it'll be back to normal.
 
 1. Delete `void_critGlasses.bnk`
 2. Rename `void_critGlasses.bnk.orig` to `void_critGlasses.bnk`
 3. Enjoy?
